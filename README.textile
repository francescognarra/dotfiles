My dotfiles

This repository includes my configuration files, it also contains a _Rakefile_ for syncing file.

In the following a brief description of the files:

h2. bash

My bash config loads completion files for git, ri and rake, it also contains some personal aliases. Furthermore, It loads *rvm* and sets a very personal prompt.

h2. gem

I find very annoying that gem tries to download docs for each gem I try to install so I wrote this little file to speed up gem installations.

h2. git

My git config contains usual configs, some aliases and personal colours. It also contains a setting to load a global *.gitignore* file.

h2. irb 

My irb configuration is quite simple. It uses *wirble* for colourize itself and *irb history* extensions in order to remember previous session commands.
Furthermore it adds a method to Object to investigate interesting methods of a given object.
Finally, it loads a *.rails* file if irb is called as a _rails console_ script. This rails file contains two methods to enable or disable ActiveRecord logger and also requires the *hirb* gem.

h2. vim 

I use the following plugins:

* FuzzyFinder
* FuzzyFinderTextmate
* NERDTree
* codepath
* rails
* snipMate
* textile

I also use personal settings for these plugins and for vim itself.
